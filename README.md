# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that automatically classifies IMDb movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their text. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model helps understand audience sentiment and reception of movies.


## What This Project Does

* Loads and explores the IMDb movie review dataset.
* Cleans and preprocesses raw text data (removes HTML tags, special characters, etc.).
* Extracts meaningful features from the text for model training.
* Develops and compares multiple classification algorithms to find the best model.
* Tunes model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
* Evaluates the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Why This Is Important

Understanding sentiment in reviews helps:

* Businesses and filmmakers gauge audience reactions.
* Content creators improve recommendations.
* Analysts monitor public opinion efficiently.


## Dataset Description

* **Review Text:** The content of the movie review written by users.
* **Sentiment Label:** Binary label indicating if the review is positive or negative.
* The dataset contains a balanced number of positive and negative reviews with diverse text lengths.


## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Exploration:**
   Check dataset properties, verify no missing values, and analyze text length variation.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   Remove unwanted HTML tags, special characters, and noise from the review text.

3. **Text Preprocessing:**
   Apply techniques like tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization (if used).

4. **Feature Extraction:**
   Convert text into numerical features using methods such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.

5. **Model Development:**
   Train multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) on the features.

6. **Model Tuning:**
   Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best one.


## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* pandas, numpy (data handling)
* scikit-learn (modeling, feature extraction, and evaluation)
* nltk, re (text preprocessing)
* matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)


## How to Use This Project

* Load the IMDb review dataset.
* Perform cleaning and preprocessing on the review text.
* Extract features using TF-IDF or other methods.
* Train classification models on processed data.
* Evaluate and compare model performance.
* Use the best model to predict sentiment on new movie reviews.


## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of natural language processing and machine learning to understand public sentiment in movie reviews. It provides a practical approach to text classification problems and helps users learn how to handle, analyze, and model textual data effectively.
